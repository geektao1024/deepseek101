    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How do I add new subscription sources in RSS Translator?",
        "answer": "Adding new RSS subscription sources is very simple. First, log into your RSS Translator account and click the 'Add New Source' button on the main interface. You can add sources in three ways: by directly entering the RSS source URL, uploading an OPML file (containing multiple RSS sources), or using the built-in search directory to find popular RSS sources. After adding, the system will ask you to set target translation language, update frequency, and notification preferences. If the RSS source requires authentication, you can add login credentials in the advanced options. For websites that don't provide RSS, RSS Translator also offers web scraping functionality that can convert any regularly updated webpage into an RSS source. Once completed, the system will automatically start checking for updates and translating new content. You can edit or delete added sources at any time through the 'Manage Sources' page."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is the translation quality of RSS Translator? What languages are supported?",
        "answer": "RSS Translator uses DeepSeek's AI translation engine, providing near-professional level translation quality. The system particularly excels at understanding context and technical terminology, ensuring translations are both accurate and fluent. It currently supports mutual translation between over 50 languages, including English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, German, French, Spanish, Arabic, and other major world languages. For content in specific domains such as technical, medical, or legal articles, users can enable domain optimization options to further improve the accuracy of terminology translation. The system can also learn from user corrections and preferences, continuously improving targeted translation quality over time. It's worth noting that while AI translation is very advanced, there may still be room for improvement with highly creative texts (such as poetry) or highly specialized content, in which case users can use the built-in translation editing tools for fine-tuning."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does RSS Translator support offline use? How is data synchronized?",
        "answer": "RSS Translator employs a hybrid architecture design, supporting partial offline functionality. When an internet connection is available, the system automatically synchronizes RSS updates and performs online translation. All translated content is cached to the local device, allowing users to access previously translated articles in an offline state. When reconnected to the network, the system automatically synchronizes new content and updates translations. For desktop and mobile applications, user data is synchronized via the cloud, ensuring you can access the same collection of RSS sources and reading history on any device. Advanced users can configure local translation models to run translation functions in completely offline environments, though this requires higher device specifications. Users can adjust synchronization behavior in settings, such as choosing to sync complete content only in WiFi environments or setting cache size limits. All user preference settings and reading states are synchronized in real-time to all logged-in devices."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I set different translation and notification strategies for different RSS sources?",
        "answer": "RSS Translator provides a flexible source management system, allowing independent translation and notification strategies to be set for each RSS source or source group. On the 'Source Management' page, select a specific RSS source or create a source group, then click 'Advanced Settings'. Here, you can configure dedicated translation parameters for that source (such as target language, preserved term lists, formality level, etc.) as well as independent notification strategies (such as update frequency, notification method, silent periods, etc.). For important sources, you can enable the 'Priority Translation' option to ensure these source updates receive the fastest translation processing. You can also set content-based intelligent notification rules, such as 'only send notifications when articles contain specific keywords' or 'provide summaries rather than full text when translated content exceeds a specific length'. These settings can be adjusted at any time and support copying configurations to other sources, facilitating batch setup of similar sources. For enterprise users, role-based source strategy management is also supported, allowing different team members to receive translated content targeted to their respective professional domains."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does RSS Translator provide API or integration options?",
        "answer": "Yes, RSS Translator provides a full-featured REST API, supporting integration with other systems and workflows. Through the API, developers can programmatically add/manage RSS sources, retrieve translated content, trigger manual updates, or query system status. The API uses standard OAuth2 authentication and provides detailed documentation and sample code. Additionally, RSS Translator offers various integration options, including Webhook support (triggering custom actions when new translated content is available), email integration (regularly sending translation summaries), Slack/Teams notifications, browser extensions, and more. Particularly noteworthy is the deep integration with knowledge management tools like Notion and Evernote, allowing automatic saving of translated content to these platforms. For developers, we provide open-source SDKs supporting mainstream programming languages, simplifying custom application development. Enterprise users can achieve seamless connections with internal knowledge bases, content management systems, or business intelligence tools through the API, creating automated multilingual content management workflows."
