      {
        "question": "What privacy considerations should I be aware of when using Easydict?",
        "answer": "When using Easydict, several privacy aspects are important to understand: First, the application itself does not collect or store user data beyond what's necessary for core functionality, with translation history stored locally on your device by default. However, Easydict functions as an intermediary that sends text to various third-party translation services, each with their own privacy policies regarding data retention and usage. To manage this, Easydict provides granular control over which services you use, allowing you to select providers based on their privacy practices or restrict usage to services you trust. For sensitive content, consider using services like DeepSeek that offer stronger privacy commitments, or utilize the application's offline dictionary capabilities which process text locally without internet transmission. The application's history management includes privacy options such as automatic history expiration, manual clearing, and the ability to disable history recording entirely for sensitive translation sessions. For organizational use with confidential information, consider implementing additional measures such as VPN connections when transmitting sensitive content to translation services. As an open-source application, Easydict's code is publicly available for review, allowing security-conscious users to verify how data is handled and transmitted. While Easydict itself implements strong privacy practices, understanding the policies of the underlying translation services you choose to enable remains important for comprehensive privacy management."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Easydict's DeepSeek integration enhance translation capabilities?",
        "answer": "Easydict's integration with DeepSeek significantly enhances translation quality through several advanced capabilities: DeepSeek's sophisticated language models provide context-aware translation that understands nuanced meanings beyond literal word equivalents, capturing idioms, cultural references, and implied context that conventional translation engines often miss. For technical and specialized content, the DeepSeek integration delivers superior handling of domain-specific terminology in fields like medicine, law, technology, and science, preserving precise technical meaning that general-purpose translators frequently misinterpret. The advanced reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek models enable more natural sentence construction in the target language, maintaining appropriate tone, formality level, and stylistic elements that create more authentic-sounding translations. For ambiguous terms or phrases with multiple potential interpretations, DeepSeek can analyze surrounding context to select the most appropriate translation rather than defaulting to the most common meaning. The integration also excels at handling complex grammatical structures and linguistic patterns that challenge rule-based translation systems, particularly for language pairs with significant structural differences. When translating longer passages, DeepSeek maintains coherence and consistency throughout the text, preserving references, maintaining proper noun handling, and ensuring logical flow across paragraphs. These enhanced capabilities make the DeepSeek integration particularly valuable for professional content, creative writing, technical documentation, and other scenarios where translation quality and contextual understanding are critical."
      },
      {
        "question": "What customization options does Easydict provide?",
        "answer": "Easydict offers extensive customization capabilities designed to adapt the translation experience to individual preferences and workflows: Interface customization includes options for window behavior (floating or standard), opacity settings, size preferences, and appearance modes including automatic light/dark mode switching based on system settings. Access method customization allows users to configure global keyboard shortcuts for various functions, selection-based popup behavior including activation triggers and positioning, menu bar presence and behavior, and clipboard monitoring settings for automatic translation of copied text. Service configuration provides granular control over which translation and dictionary providers are active, service priority ordering that determines which services are queried first, and provider-specific settings including API keys and regional configurations. Language preferences can be extensively customized with default source and target language settings, frequently-used language pairs for quick switching, language detection behavior, and specialized handling for specific language combinations. Privacy settings include history management options (retention period, automatic clearing, disabled recording), service restriction for sensitive content, and local processing preferences for offline operation when possible. Performance customization allows configuration of parallel query behavior, timeout settings, retry logic, and caching parameters to optimize speed and reliability. Appearance settings include font selection, text size, color themes, and result display formatting to match personal visual preferences. This comprehensive customization ensures that Easydict can be precisely tailored to individual requirements across diverse use cases and personal preferences."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Easydict handle technical and specialized terminology?",
        "answer": "Easydict implements several sophisticated approaches for handling technical and specialized terminology: The multi-service architecture plays a crucial role by routing technical content to providers with strong domain-specific capabilities, such as using DeepSeek for scientific content or specialized dictionary services for legal or medical terminology. For recognized technical fields, Easydict applies domain detection that identifies subject matter including medicine, law, engineering, computer science, finance, or academic disciplines, adjusting translation approaches accordingly. The application's dictionary functionality provides detailed technical definitions with field-specific context, usage examples within the domain, and alternative translations based on different technical contexts. When integrated with AI services like DeepSeek, Easydict leverages advanced language models that understand specialized vocabulary within proper context, maintaining terminological precision that general translation systems often miss. For consistent terminology in ongoing projects, the application's history feature preserves previous translations of technical terms, enabling consistent handling across multiple translation sessions. The system implements specialized glossary capabilities that can recognize and preserve established technical terms, product names, and standardized nomenclature during translation. For highly specialized content, Easydict provides transparent multi-service results that show how different providers translate technical terms, allowing users to select the most appropriate option based on domain knowledge. These combined approaches ensure that technical terminology receives appropriate specialized handling rather than generic translation, preserving precise meaning in professional and specialized contexts."
