    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "How can I integrate DeepSeek models with Chatbox?",
        "answer": "Chatbox provides straightforward DeepSeek integration through its custom API configuration panel. To connect DeepSeek models, navigate to Settings > Models > Add Custom Model, then enter your DeepSeek API key and endpoint details. Chatbox supports the full range of DeepSeek model parameters including temperature, top_p, frequency penalty, and specialized configurations. The application handles authentication, request formatting, and response parsing automatically, making the entire process remarkably simple. Once configured, DeepSeek models appear alongside other providers in your model selection menu, allowing seamless switching between different AI capabilities based on your current needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "What API keys do I need to use Chatbox effectively?",
        "answer": "Chatbox requires an API key from at least one language model provider to function. Most users begin with an OpenAI API key (for GPT models) which can be obtained through OpenAI's platform. For expanded capabilities, you may optionally add keys for DeepSeek's powerful models, Anthropic (Claude models), Azure OpenAI, or configure custom endpoints for open-source models. The application securely stores these keys locally on your device rather than on remote servers. You'll only be charged based on your actual usage according to each provider's pricing model, with no additional fees from Chatbox itself. For professional users, the DeepSeek API integration is particularly valuable for specialized tasks requiring advanced reasoning and domain expertise."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Chatbox handle privacy and data security with API integrations?",
        "answer": "Chatbox takes a fundamentally different approach to privacy compared to web-based alternatives. All conversation history and API keys, including DeepSeek API credentials, are stored locally on your device, not on remote servers. Communications with language model providers follow their standard encryption protocols, but the desktop application architecture eliminates many common web vulnerabilities. No usage data is collected beyond what's required for the functioning of the application, and the open-source nature of Chatbox means all code is transparent and can be verified by the community. This architecture provides significantly enhanced privacy without compromising functionality, and API calls to services like DeepSeek are made directly from your machine without intermediate servers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What languages does Chatbox support for its interface and content?",
        "answer": "Chatbox features comprehensive internationalization with interface support for over 15 languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Japanese, Korean, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Arabic, and Hindi. The application automatically detects your system language and adjusts accordingly, though this can be manually overridden in settings. Beyond interface language, Chatbox can work with content in any language supported by your chosen language model provider, with most modern models including DeepSeek offering robust multilingual capabilities. The DeepSeek API integration is particularly valuable for users working with Asian languages, where DeepSeek models demonstrate exceptional understanding of cultural nuances and linguistic patterns."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I set up and use custom model endpoints with Chatbox?",
        "answer": "Chatbox provides flexible integration options for custom model endpoints through its advanced settings panel. Users can configure connections to DeepSeek models, self-hosted instances, local deployments, or specialized API services by providing the endpoint URL, required authentication details, and model parameters. The application supports various authentication methods including API keys, bearer tokens, and basic authentication. Chatbox is compatible with any API endpoint that follows OpenAI-compatible formatting standards, including popular frameworks like LM Studio, Ollama, and self-hosted instances of models such as DeepSeek, Llama, Mistral, and Falcon. This capability is particularly valuable for users with specific compliance requirements or those working with proprietary DeepSeek model deployments in enterprise environments."
