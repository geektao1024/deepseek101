        "question": "How does Alpha Pai handle conflicting information or uncertainty in financial data?",
        "answer": "Alpha Pai employs sophisticated approaches for managing conflicting information and uncertainty, which are common challenges in financial analysis. When encountering contradictory data points from different sources, the system implements a multi-step resolution process: First, it clearly identifies the conflict to users rather than making arbitrary selections, presenting the contradictory information with source attribution and confidence assessments. For numerical discrepancies, Alpha Pai attempts reconciliation by identifying potential methodological differences, time period variations, or definitional inconsistencies that might explain the divergence. The platform maintains awareness of source reliability hierarchies, giving precedence to primary documents like official filings over secondary sources while still presenting all perspectives. For forward-looking information with inherent uncertainty, Alpha Pai presents ranges of possibilities rather than single point estimates, often implementing scenario analysis that considers multiple potential outcomes with associated probabilities and key determining factors. When responding to user queries involving ambiguous or uncertain information, the system clearly communicates confidence levels and limitations, avoiding false precision while providing the most accurate analysis possible given available data. This transparent approach to uncertainty management ensures that investment decisions are based on realistic understanding of information quality and potential variability rather than artificial certainty."
