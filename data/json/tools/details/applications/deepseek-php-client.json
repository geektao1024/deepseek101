    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What PHP versions are supported by the DeepSeek PHP Client?",
        "answer": "The DeepSeek PHP Client is designed to work with PHP 8.0 and higher, taking advantage of modern PHP language features while maintaining broad compatibility with current PHP environments. The core library requires PHP 8.0 as a minimum version to utilize type declarations, named arguments, union types, and other language enhancements that improve code quality and developer experience. For optimal performance and feature support, PHP 8.1 or 8.2 is recommended, as these versions enable additional optimizations and language capabilities used by the client. For legacy systems running PHP 7.4, the library provides a compatibility layer that offers core functionality with some feature limitations, primarily around type safety and advanced parameter handling. This compatibility layer is maintained as a separate branch with critical updates but may not receive all new features. The client is regularly tested against all supported PHP versions on various operating systems including Linux, macOS, and Windows to ensure consistent behavior across environments. For PHP 8.3 (and future versions), the library typically adds support through minor updates shortly after stable PHP releases, allowing early adopters to leverage new language features while maintaining backward compatibility with existing implementations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the DeepSeek PHP Client handle API authentication?",
        "answer": "The DeepSeek PHP Client implements a flexible, security-focused authentication system designed to accommodate various deployment scenarios while maintaining best practices for credential management. The primary authentication method uses API keys, which can be provided through several approaches: direct configuration during client initialization, environment variables (DEEPSEEK_API_KEY), configuration files with appropriate permission restrictions, or integration with framework-specific secret management systems. For enhanced security in production environments, the client supports credential providers that can retrieve authentication information from secure storage systems including AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or custom enterprise credential stores. The authentication system implements proper security practices including encryption of keys in memory, redaction of credentials in logs and error messages, and automatic token refresh for authentication methods with expiring credentials. For organizations with custom authentication requirements, the client provides an extensible authentication interface that allows implementation of specialized authentication flows including OAuth, SAML integration, or proprietary single sign-on systems. The library also includes support for organization-level authentication with role-based access control for enterprise deployments where multiple teams share API access with different permission levels. This comprehensive approach ensures secure, flexible authentication that adapts to various operational requirements while maintaining strong security practices."
      },
      {
        "question": "What error handling mechanisms does the client provide?",
        "answer": "The DeepSeek PHP Client implements a comprehensive error handling system designed to provide clear information about failure points while enabling sophisticated recovery strategies. At the core of this system is a specialized exception hierarchy that categorizes errors into meaningful types including authentication failures, rate limiting issues, invalid requests, server errors, and network problems. Each exception type includes detailed contextual information such as request parameters, response data, HTTP status codes, and timestamp information that aids in troubleshooting. For transient errors like rate limiting or temporary service disruptions, the client provides built-in retry mechanisms with configurable policies including attempt limits, backoff strategies, and jitter to prevent retry storms in high-concurrency environments. The error handling system integrates with PSR-3 compatible logging interfaces, automatically recording detailed error information at appropriate severity levels while respecting privacy considerations for sensitive content. For production environments, the client includes fallback mechanisms that can switch to alternative models or degraded operation modes when primary services are unavailable. The library also provides helper methods for common error recovery patterns, allowing developers to implement sophisticated handling with minimal code. This robust approach to error management ensures applications can gracefully handle API disruptions while providing the detailed information needed for effective troubleshooting and monitoring."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does the client handle large language model responses, particularly for streaming?",
        "answer": "The DeepSeek PHP Client implements sophisticated handling for large language model responses with particular attention to memory efficiency and real-time processing capabilities. For streaming responses, the client provides a dedicated streaming interface that processes model outputs incrementally as they arrive rather than waiting for complete responses. This streaming implementation supports both synchronous processing through iterators and asynchronous handling via callback functions or PSR-7 compatible streams. The streaming system includes specialized handlers for different response types including text completions, chat messages, and structured data, with appropriate parsing and event triggering for each chunk type. For memory management with large responses, the client implements efficient buffer handling that processes content in controlled chunks rather than loading entire responses into memory, preventing memory exhaustion with lengthy generations. The implementation includes safeguards against common streaming challenges including connection interruptions, malformed chunks, and timeout handling with appropriate error recovery. For framework integration, the streaming capabilities connect seamlessly with framework-specific response mechanisms including Laravel's streaming responses, Symfony's StreamedResponse, and similar patterns in other frameworks. The client also provides utilities for common streaming use cases including real-time display formatting, progress tracking, and partial result processing that enable sophisticated user experiences with streaming AI content. This comprehensive approach to response handling ensures reliable performance even with extensive model outputs while enabling real-time applications that leverage incremental content generation."
