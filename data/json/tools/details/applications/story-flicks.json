    "overview": "Story-Flicks is an innovative open-source application that transforms simple text prompts into complete story-based short videos using advanced AI technology. With just a single sentence describing a story theme, the platform leverages large language models, including DeepSeek, to generate comprehensive story content, which is then paired with AI-generated images, audio narration, and synchronized subtitles to create engaging video narratives.\n\nBuilt with a Python and FastAPI backend, complemented by a React and Ant Design frontend, Story-Flicks offers a user-friendly interface that simplifies the otherwise complex process of video creation. The application supports multiple AI model providers for both text and image generation, giving users flexibility in choosing models that best suit their needs or preferences.\n\nWhether for educational content, creative storytelling, or digital marketing, Story-Flicks opens up new possibilities for quick video production without requiring specialized skills or equipment. Its segment-based approach to story creation allows for structured narratives with corresponding visuals, resulting in coherent and engaging short-form video content that can be generated with minimal input and technical knowledge.",

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What AI models does Story-Flicks support?",
        "answer": "Story-Flicks supports multiple AI providers for both text and image generation. For text generation, it supports OpenAI (like GPT-4o), DeepSeek, Aliyun (Qwen models), Ollama (recommended with larger models like qwen2.5:14b), and SiliconFlow. For image generation, it supports OpenAI (like DALL-E 3), Aliyun (such as flux-dev), and SiliconFlow models."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I integrate DeepSeek models with Story-Flicks?",
        "answer": "To use DeepSeek models with Story-Flicks, you need to set 'text_provider' to 'deepseek' in your environment configuration, provide your DeepSeek API key, and set the appropriate base URL for the DeepSeek API. Currently, DeepSeek is supported for text generation. Detailed configuration instructions are available in the project documentation."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to generate a video?",
        "answer": "The generation time depends on several factors including the number of story segments (each requiring an image), the models being used, and your system resources. Generally, a story with 5-10 segments might take a few minutes to complete. More segments will increase the generation time proportionally."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I control the content and style of the generated stories?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can influence the content and style by specifying the story theme and adjusting the number of segments. The application allows you to select the text and image generation models, which can also affect the style and quality of the output. More detailed control would require modifications to the prompts used in the backend code."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the system requirements for running Story-Flicks?",
        "answer": "Story-Flicks is primarily a web application that relies on external API services for AI capabilities. For deployment, you need Python 3.10+ for the backend and Node.js for the frontend. The application can be run on most modern operating systems. For Docker deployment, you need Docker and Docker Compose installed. The actual processing is done via API calls, so the local system requirements are modest."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does Story-Flicks work offline or require internet connectivity?",
        "answer": "Story-Flicks requires internet connectivity to function properly as it relies on API calls to various AI service providers for text and image generation. The exception is if you're using Ollama locally for text generation, but even then, image generation and other components typically require external API access."
      },
      {
        "question": "What file format and resolution are the output videos?",
        "answer": "The videos are generally output in MP4 format with standard HD resolution. The exact specifications may vary depending on the configuration and the image generation models used. The application uses MoviePy for video generation, which supports various output formats and quality settings."
