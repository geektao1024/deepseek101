    "overview": "LiberSonora, meaning \"Free Voice\", is an AI-powered, open-source audiobook toolkit designed to operate entirely offline with GPU acceleration capabilities. The platform solves common audiobook management problems through intelligent subtitle extraction, smart title generation, and multilingual translation support.\n\nDesigned with modularity in mind, LiberSonora allows users to leverage specific services independently or as a complete solution, offering flexibility for various audiobook processing needs. The toolkit supports multiple large language models, including local Ollama, DeepSeek, and OpenAI, giving users choice and control over their AI processing requirements.\n\nWith its batch processing capabilities, LiberSonora can efficiently handle large quantities of audiobooks, eliminating the need for tedious manual processing. Its support for local audio file processing improves efficiency by removing file transfer steps, while also ensuring complete data privacy and security as all processing happens offline.\n\nThe project is developed with the vision of creating a comprehensive audiobook ecosystem, with the current implementation focused on intelligent subtitle extraction, title generation, and multilingual support - core features that transform how users organize, access, and engage with audiobook content.",

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What hardware requirements does LiberSonora have?",
        "answer": "LiberSonora currently requires an NVIDIA GPU environment due to its dependencies on the clear-voice and funasr projects for optimal performance. The minimum recommended specifications include an NVIDIA GPU with at least 4GB of VRAM, 8GB of system RAM, and sufficient storage space for your audiobooks and the Docker containers. CPU-only operation is listed as a low-priority future feature that may not be implemented."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I integrate DeepSeek models with LiberSonora?",
        "answer": "DeepSeek integration is available through the multi-model selection interface. After starting the application, navigate to the model selection section, choose DeepSeek as your provider, input your API key, and select the appropriate models for your specific tasks such as subtitle correction, title generation, or translation. The detailed configuration instructions are available in the application's interface."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can LiberSonora process audiobooks in languages other than English and Chinese?",
        "answer": "Yes, LiberSonora supports multilingual audio processing, though performance may vary depending on the language and the selected AI models. The system currently has optimized support for English and Chinese audiobooks, but can theoretically work with any language supported by the underlying speech recognition and large language models you configure."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a limit to the audiobook length LiberSonora can process?",
        "answer": "LiberSonora supports processing audiobooks over 3 hours in length, which covers most standard audiobooks. For extremely long audiobooks, the system can still process them, but may divide them into manageable segments internally. Processing time will increase proportionally with the length of the audio file."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the subtitle generation and translation?",
        "answer": "The accuracy of subtitle generation depends on the audio quality, background noise, and the selected speech recognition model. For clear audio recordings with minimal background noise, accuracy rates can be very high. Translation quality depends on the selected language model - using advanced models like those from DeepSeek generally provides high-quality translations that preserve context and meaning."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use LiberSonora with my existing audiobook management software?",
        "answer": "Yes, LiberSonora is designed to complement existing audiobook management systems. It processes your audio files and generates subtitles and metadata that can be used with other applications. Additionally, its API support allows for integration with custom workflows and other software solutions if you have development resources."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I deploy LiberSonora on my system?",
        "answer": "LiberSonora uses Docker for easy deployment. After cloning the repository from GitHub, you can start the application using the provided docker-compose file with the command 'docker-compose -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d'. This will set up all necessary services. Detailed installation instructions are available in the project's README file on GitHub."
